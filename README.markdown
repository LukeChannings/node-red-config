Luke's Node-RED config
---

![Example](./screenshot.png)

This is a Node Red project containing flows to control:

- Lights
- Fan controls
- Time-based automated actions, e.g. starting the robot vaccuum.

This project is managed using Node Red's versioned projects support. It's configured via settings and environment variables found in my kubeconfig [here](https://github.com/LukeChannings/kube-config/tree/master/apps/smart-home/node-red).
